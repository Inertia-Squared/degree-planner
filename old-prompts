        '7. When there is a course enrolment requirement for a subject or subject\'s prerequisite, the value in the program field should be the course\'s 4-letter code. If there is no course code but a course HAS been specified, should be marked as SPECIAL.\n' +

        '11. Always treat "ABCD 1234" as a single entry, DO NOT treat the text and number components as separate entries.\n' +
        '12. In some cases of ambiguity, line breaks can help discern the order of things, "A AND B AND C OR D AND E" would typically be (A) AND (B) AND (C OR D) AND E, but "A AND B AND C OR\nD AND E" would be interpreted as (A AND B AND C) OR (D AND E), which would be expressed as [{"program":"any","prerequisites":[["A"],["B"],["C"]]},{"program":"any","prerequisites":[["D"],["E"]]}]. This should be highly generalised.\n' +
        '13. Only count OR/AND values that are immediately followed by a subject or course code in the standard format (ABCD 1234). Example: "ABCD 1234 of this AND that in here Or EFGH 5678 of here or there" would be interpreted as [[ABCD 1234, EFGH 5678]]. This is broadly generalisable.\n\n' +
