The subject claims to engage students with current global contexts to integrate professional knowledge and develop skills, attitudes and behaviours that support them to be global citizens with inter-cultural competence. As part of the subject students will be required to undertake an global learning experience relevant to their studies. This experience may involve travel to an overseas organisation and/or community, or participation with a local or online globally focused organisation. The subject is completed across a year of study, with the first semester a preparatory experience, mid-semester the opportunity to complete an global short program, and the final semester a time to reflect. Students will immerse themselves in their new global environment, make sense of the organisation's or a community's modes of action and meaning, and negotiate their ways of acting and being in the process of becoming a member and contributing to the organisation and/or community with which they engage. Students in this subject will reflect on global engagement experiences to discuss self-learning and how this learning informs personal and professional development.",

Medical microbiology is subdivided into four areas: virology, bacteriology, mycology (the study of fungi) and parasitology. The rapid evolution of microbes means that this is an area that does not remain static. This subject has a modern approach to the study of the balance between the host, humans, and the very large army of potential invaders. Students will embark on a journey into the world of pathogenic micro-organisms exploring the molecular mechanisms by which these override host defences leading to disease. Infectious diseases of the human body systems as well those of the immunocompromised and infections contracted in the healthcare setting (nosocomial) are discussed. The theory will be supported with laboratory experience representing diagnostic procedures for the identification of infectious agents.",

Students' analytic and problem solving skills are developed through analysis of impacts including non-elastic deformation, orientation of the reference axes, and how materials fail. Using knowledge about materials, students evaluate impacts on materials, the mechanisms to control properties of materials, and use mathematical calculations and techniques to determine stresses and strains on simple components. Overall, students develop the capacity to select appropriate materials and improve mechanical design.",

The focus for this subject is on rigid body kinematics, which involves the study of a solid body with little or no deformation in planar motion, such as those in machines. The motion of key machine components and the forces they generate gives rise to design problems. Students gain an understanding of the relevance of kinematics and kinetics in the analysis and design of mechanical systems and of methods to ensure machines operate efficiently and safely.",

    "description": "Performance as a Professional Musician builds upon preceding subjects in the Performance sub-major to equip students for performance opportunities in real-world environments. Subject matter canvassed includes arrangement and interpretation, real-world writing about performance, stagecraft and event production. With the guidance of the subject coordinator/tutors, vetted through a professional project proposal process, students will prepare and mount a 30-minute performance project as featured performer. The type of repertoire, instrumentation and personnel will be up to the student and will reflect acquired strengths and aspirations. Through a workshop process, students will be encouraged to refine their performance and to further develop their capacity to give colleagues measured and constructive feedback. Short written tasks reflect real-world expectations of the professional musician in the form of project proposal, program note and festival pitch.",

It will have two focuses: songwriting in both popular and art-music traditions to allow for the exploration of lyrics/texts; and composer collaborations with large scores for film, photography and dance. Students will work in a wide variety of commonly-employed artistic media and genres at a higher level than in the preceding subject. They will acquire the ability to write for larger instrumental combinations in cross-artform collaborations and songwriting skills. Practical workshops using compositional principles through student improvisation within creative groups will provide sonic demonstration of compositional ideas in relation to songwriting and other media. The assessments will include both notated scores (with visual media options) and recordings (improvisation; one notated score), in keeping with the Internet distribution age.",

    "description": "Examining the social construction of gender has been central to anthropological inquiries since the 1930s.  Early ethnographic studies were instrumental in debunking gender essentialism and challenging the hegemony of western constructs about 'masculinity' and 'femininity'. Since the 1930s, critical Anthropological theories and ethnographies have through cross-cultural comparison, demonstrated the great variation in expressions of individual sexuality/ies, the dynamics and confines behind the construction of gender roles and the cultural meaning and expression of gender categories across the globe. This subject will address the ongoing exploration of and challenges to the sex (biology) vs. gender (culture) dichotomy and contemporary cultural, social and political transformation (manipulation) of these categories.",

    "description": "This is a post beginner level subject in Japanese built on the knowledge and skills developed in Japanese 101 and aims to further develop listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in elementary Japanese. Students who believe they have sufficient background in Japanese to do 102 without having done 101 should apply by e-form for a Rule Waiver, explaining their situation, and have their language level evaluated. Students with a background of study in the language need to obtain advice on their appropriate level of language study. During the first two weeks of class, the lecturer will monitor the performance of students and advise students who need to transfer to a higher class. Students should consult the Languages Academic Course Advisor or Subject Coordinator if they are unsure of their entry level.",

    "description": "This is a 80 credit point year-long subject taken over two terms (40 credit points in each term). Foundational learning for medicine is provided in this yearlong subject that integrates the biomedical sciences through the use of authentic clinical scenarios. Small group problem based learning, bedside teaching with patients and procedural skills teaching scaffolded by lectures, tutorials and practicals cover each of the body systems in turn, so that students are well prepared for clinical learning. Students will also learn about the human context of health and disease, medical professionalism, the quality and safety of healthcare, evidence based practice, research and clinical skills through community visits, hospital based-sessions and workshops. The Professional Portfolio component within this subject will provide students in the Doctor of Medicine (MD) program with the means to monitor and support their acquisition of professional competencies in medicine. Supported by teaching sessions, learning resources and Professional Advisors, students will collate and review evidence of their learning, such as clinical assessments and case studies, preparatory work and outcomes from research and scholarly projects. By identifying and addressing their learning and professional development needs, students will create their own personalised learning journey as the basis for life-long learning in medicine. The Professional Portfolio will also prepare students for the portfolios used extensively in post graduate specialty training in medicine.",

After introducing the fundamental principles of security and privacy, these will be explored while considering how these principles shape the experience of users who are interacting with the designed product. Humans are an essential part of security and privacy, and they also inherently pose significant challenges. Students will be introduced to some of the fundamental security and privacy standards and regulations. They will learn about cognitive and perceptual approaches to usable security as well as how to create systems that are usable and trusted alongside fulfilling the requirements of remaining secure and private. Research topics such as how to design user studies to critically evaluate security, privacy, trust and usability interfaces will be addressed to provide students with an informed view on emerging best practices.",

Machine Learning is relevant for solving a range of problems in many industries dealing with significant amounts of information and the structure of that information. In this unit, students put Machine Learning theory into action through widely used algorithms and practical applications for designing, training, and evaluating common learning models and systems. Students use Python programming and, as a result, learn about its important machine learning libraries and packages, such as Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow for solving practical problems and tasks.",

Literature's potent combination of pleasure and instruction embraces conflicting personal, ethical, political, social, and ideological uses even as it resists them. The subject brings a comparative focus to bear on texts from diverse historical and cultural settings as a way of reflecting on and rediscovering the value of literature in the digital age. Students will also explore the function of criticism to educate the individual sensibility and shape the cultures of public life. Primary texts include poems, narrative fiction, essays, and may include drama, film, and other audiovisual material.",

    "description": "Students will participate in a 30-day professional experience set in the context of their future profession and under the supervision of qualified teachers. This is the final professional experience subject in your degree.  The completion of this Professional Experience recognises you as a conditionally qualified teacher.  This subject aims to recognise your shift from pre-service teacher to beginning teacher. Students will be prepared by exploring issues involved in understanding the needs of learners within specific school and classroom contexts, and will design and teach experiences in ways that will enhance student engagement and student learning outcomes.  The subject is designed to develop your professional identity and the importance of continued professional learning, the relationship between professional and community organisations in supporting educators, and how these influence student outcomes. It will build awareness of skills and practices that will help facilitate preservice teacher's personal wellbeing and resilience in their teaching career. The subject links theory and practice and enables students to construct new knowledge and new ways of practice as part of their transition into the teaching profession. In line with primary teaching specialisation requirements, your professional experience may focus on teaching, evaluating and assessing in the subject area of Science and Technology. Students are required to analyse their own learning in relation to the Graduate Teacher Standards through the completion of a Learning Portfolio and the TPA (Teaching Performance Assessment).

Students will draw on contemporary theories of literacy learning and teaching, and will examine a repertoire of teaching and assessment strategies for deconstructing and constructing a range of texts in classrooms. By investigating a range of written and multimodal genres, their textual structures and grammar, students will develop their meta-semiotic awareness. This awareness is crucial when they plan to teach primary school students literacy skills related to various learning areas of the Australian Curriculum. In this subject, students' technological, pedagogical and content knowledge is progressively enhanced to prepare them to teach innovatively with digital media with simultaneous infusion of emergent language and literacy practices.

Students' understanding of a design brief, client, competitors and audience will deepen and they will be introduced to some design specific research skills, such as mood board and persona development, which will help them begin to build a toolkit of methods to use throughout their degree. Students will explore the power of storytelling in the creation of compelling brand narratives and explore ways a brand can communicate with an intended audience. Key software will be introduced and supported by online resources, and students will continue to develop their visual design and communication skills in the fundamental areas of typography, image-making and composition.",

Skills will be developed and practiced in practical workshops allowing students to acquire a level of understanding and mastery of movements. Students will also be guided in drawing connections between these more traditional sport-based activities and other recreational and lifestyle physical activities. This will prepare graduates to be able to design innovative and creative learning opportunities that expose school students to a variety of physical activity learning opportunities within physical education whereby students’ movement knowledge can be directly translated into active pursuits and interests outside of school. Students’ learning will be guided by meaningful movement pedagogy and discovery-based teaching strategies.",

The complexity of the strategy process, content and context means that there is not one clear position on strategy. The impact of this complexity on managers seeking to develop a strategic thinking capability is examined. The paradoxes and debates in the field of strategy are explored in an effort to understand the concept of sustainable competitive advantage. Students will utilise the theoretical knowledge presented in a dialectical enquiry framework to undertake strategic analysis, and develop a selection of strategic options, for case study scenarios and in a team strategy simulation.",

One way to do this is to set up a mathematical model which we hope can provide insights, predictions and a greater understanding of a complex system. Selected real-world problems are approximated by mathematical models that are amenable to being written in terms of linear and non-linear equations or differential equations.  Once equations are solved emphasis is placed on interpreting solutions, modifying models as required and using  models for prediction.",

It aims to give students, enrolled in the Western Sydney University MBBS, the opportunity to develop their critical thinking and gain a more detailed experience in medical research than is provided in the medical program. It consists of a research project in any area of medical research for which the School can provide suitable supervision. Students will study the relevant literature, develop and conduct the program of research with the assistance of their supervisor, take part in research seminars in their research group, and present the results as a dissertation.    The main learning outcomes are a subset of the 15 Learning Tasks/Outcomes for the medical program as a whole, but will be achieved at a considerably higher level than is expected in the main MBBS program. The task numbers relate to the complete set in the MBBS learning outcomes.",

Module 3 will extend the skills of reading and arranging music in students' preferred performing media (voice or instrument). In this module, they will perform set technical tasks (such as scales and arpeggios), adding to the skills acquired in Music Performance 1 and, continuing to work in small groups, they will arrange and perform one set piece of music from a basic notated score, and choose, arrange and perform another piece that is different from the music performed in Music Performance 1. They will perform one piece chosen from modules 1, 2, or 3 in a public venue on campus. The subject will also introduce music business skills, such as how to publicise and mount a performance, and how to upload a sample of work to YouTube.",

Students will be allocated a topic area from which they will identify a clinical \"problem\" or health-related issue. Students will then plan and design a robust research project to answer this question. Students will be expected to reflect on the barriers and facilitators of evidence-based practice, and develop strategies and interventions to be used to facilitate the implementation of evidence in practice by clients and health care practitioners.",

    "description": "This subject deals with pathophysiology and pathogenesis of traumatic injuries, conditions arising from uncompensated environmental exposures, and toxicological emergencies. Students are taught how to care for these patients in the out-of-hospital setting. Best patient outcomes are achieved when out-of-hospital care forms part of a trauma system. Therefore, paramedics are required to make decisions to achieve the provision of the right care and transfer to the right hospital in the right time. This unit aims to develop the knowledge and skills to safely and effectively care, treat and manage adult and paediatric patients who have sustained traumatic injury or injuries, conditions arising from uncompensated environmental exposures, and toxicological emergencies.\n\n\n\n",

This subject focuses on client assessment and evidence based management in acute cardiorespiratory physiotherapy contexts.  Students will extend and advance the knowledge, competencies and skills in cardiorespiratory physiotherapy clinical reasoning including assessment, interpretation and prioritisation of findings, synthesis of complex information along with the implementation and evaluation of appropriate treatment strategies.  This framework will also be applied to the management of patients in Intensive Care, where students will develop specialist knowledge and skills in cardiorespiratory assessment and treatment of acutely ill unstable patients with cardiorespiratory failure and complex comorbidities. This will require strong communication skills, ethical and professional behaviour and an appreciation of interprofessional care required in acute clinical scenarios including intensive care subjects.",

Students will draw upon specific case studies of the social and political organisation of a variety of communities to understand how social order is perceived, achieved and maintained cross-culturally, through local systems of governance but also through social categories such as race, kinship, ethnicity and nations. Through these examinations students will also apply anthropological insights in order to understand how social practices such as participation, collaboration, resistance and violence operate in local political contexts. In the final part of the subject students will assess the various ways anthropologists work with and against local power structures and to what extent ethnography and applied anthropological work can intervene in systems of oppression.",

Students will survey the field for their project identifying precedents and contexts, leading to experimentation and exploration of a range of potential options and addressing any arising issues, to develop a proof of concept. In the second semester students will develop the work to completion, through an iterative process of prototyping, reflection and analysis. The completed work will be prepared to a professional standard for display at a showcase event, It is expected that there will be a documented developmental process undertaken consistently across the year, resulting in the final work, which will be a professional outcome, relevant to a field of Visual Communication design.  Students are expected to be self-motivated, and work as an independent professional practitioner throughout the duration of the subject.",

    "description": "This subject introduces students to the idea that graphic designers can be agents of change. Set project briefs will focus on social and political issues exploring the potential inherent in graphic design practice to make a real difference to society. The subject will encourage students to go beyond the definition of a problem solver, encouraging them to act as a problem seeker, who can use their design thinking skills to develop ideas that respond proactively to society's problems rather than reacting to a client's set brief. The subject will introduce further design-led, social and participatory research methods, that continue to build on the design process, and further expand the methods that underpin aspects of research and practice during the remainder of the degree. Students will refine and develop their visual language skills, in combination with material and digital skills, facilitating their development as an independent learner.",

Successful communication design has always depended on the connection between form, content, audience and context, and the designer's abilities to analyse, understand and clarify the contexts of communication have become more important to creative practice. In this subject students will learn to apply the theoretical frameworks of semiotic, thematic and rhetorical analysis used by the interdisciplinary field of Design Studies to interpret design's potential as cultural expression and communication. Students will analyse visual signs and conventions as both targeted and tacit responses to a range of contexts revealing design's interests in marketplaces, society and identity. Students will analyse various graphic examples, and design literature, as they investigate the significance and agency of design interactions, media artefacts and systems.",

It combines anatomy, physiology, ecology and behaviour, to explain how vertebrates survive and reproduce in relation to their environment. We will uncover the evolutionary relationships among vertebrate groups, and examine their adaptations to different environmental challenges. The subject also explores patterns in vertebrate diversity, with a focus on Australian ecosystems. Students further develop their knowledge of the scientific method to conduct their own project to investigate how environmental factors influence vertebrate animal abundance and diversity.  Students may be required to travel to another campus to undertake this subject.",

This capstone highlights the needs for an interdisciplinary approach to define and critique forensic science evidence from various perspectives including science, law, criminology, policing and social science. Students are required to use their skills and knowledge with additional independent research and inquiry using a range of set literature. The subject will study a range of contemporary issues including how the judicial system evaluates the reliability of evidence from an admissibility threshold, identification evidence from CCTV, contextual bias with forensic examination, contamination issues with forensic evidence and methods of expressing forensic findings and/or significance.",

    "description": "In this subject students examine the nature and function of governance and accountability processes within policing and the broader private security industry. There is a focus on the commitment by governments to practices at an individual and organisational level that are based on accountability, contestability and continuous improvement. Issues such as human rights, ethics in policing, conflicts of interest, misconduct, and corruption and criminality within policing and related industries, are explored; and relevant explanatory theories are examined.  Different models and levels of governance and accountability in Australia are also explored, as are the roles of professional standards subjects within police forces, external accountability agencies such as police integrity commissions, the ombudsman, and crime and misconduct agencies . These are compared with other approaches worldwide. Throughout the subject extensive use will be made of case studies and problem based learning where students will be invited to propose solutions to real world problems.",

Assessments and workshops are designed so that students learn how to convey newly acquired skills, perspectives and life choices in different settings (classroom; job interviews and applications), and to apply the placement experience in immediate and life-long educational, professional and personal endeavours. For those students who have undertaken a placement overseas, the subject is also designed to encourage reintegration into their home culture. Specifically, assessments and workshops are designed so that students intentionally process and analyse the layered meanings of their time spent abroad, and the feelings and experiences of coming 'home'.",

These perspectives are further understood through application of the 'levels of analysis' framework.  The content then moves on to social psychology and covers topics such as: self and identity, attitudes and attitude change, conformity and obedience, prejudice and discrimination, aggression, pro-social behaviour and attraction and close relationships. Students explore the relevance of these topics to everyday life and contemporary issues.",

    "description": "This subject provides students with the opportunity to apply skills and knowledge acquired during the first two years of their degree to a 'real world' setting. Students will undertake a 14 week internationally focused placement with organisations in, for example, the community, not-for-profit or government sectors. The subject coordinator will partner students with an international organisation, and together with the placement host(s) will jointly supervise the student. The work that students undertake during placement will vary, but may include: community visits, community consultation, development of educational programs, policy evaluation, research and report writing. Relevant activities may also be undertaken at another university in the placement country. The work placement will provide students with invaluable experience working in social sciences related fields in cross-cultural contexts. Prior to commencing the placement, students are required to complete pre-placement coursework (in co-requisite subject HUMN 3100 Social Sciences International Placement (I)).  On return from placement the experience will be rounded out with the completion of HUMN 3102 Social Sciences International Placement (III). Students are required to complete a Working with Children Check, and medical clearance may also be required to undertake placement in a developing country, along with a Working With Children check for certain organisations.  Those students unable to undertake an internationally based placement for health or personal reasons should contact the Subject Coordinator before enrolment in this subject to discuss available options for being placed locally.  Students should also note that NSW Health facilities have further, specific requirements, and should seek advice from the Subject Coordinator.",

Mortality or cause of death coding will also be examined.Concepts of organising health information in a logical way to interface with an electronic information system will be investigated. The design and role of various health classification systems including the World Health Organizations Family of International Classifications (WHO FIC), specifically ICD 11 and casemix classification systems (e.g. AR DRGs, AN SNAP) will also be discussed. The practical component of this subject will focus on the student further developing their classification skills in the more complex areas of clinical coding including endocrine disorders, specifically diabetes mellitus, circulatory diseases and interventions, genitourinary disorders, specifically chronic kidney disease, obstetrics, paediatrics and congenital anomalies and trauma and procedural complications. The ACS will be applied in detail when classifying from complex discharge summaries and full clinical episodes of care. The student will also be exposed to electronic clinical coding tools that can be used in the classification process.",

They are expected to possess skills to successfully develop research projects, identify appropriate funding opportunities and communicate their knowledge by applying for research funding in line with their program of research.  In this elective subject students will develop the knowledge and skills required to draft complex grant applications - using a framework that includes research design, hypotheses, research questions, and results - while communicating information in an accurate but accessible manner.  Students will develop and refine their ideas for future research funding based on their knowledge gained across all the GCREDI subjects as well as their research studies. Students will communicate those ideas in practice through development of grant writing skills relevant to funding opportunities associated with their chosen career paths.",

The purpose of this subject is to introduce students to the world of academia, to assist them in developing the knowledge and skills required to thrive as early career researchers, and to establish networks that they can leverage in order to gain employment and be successful in their careers. Through an innovative model built on online activities and workshops, students will develop an understanding of the nature of academic work in Australia and around the world in the 21st century. Each student will partner with a mentor to develop time, project and people management skills, as well as mapping out networks to pursue near to and upon completion of the student's Doctoral (HDR) candidature.",

    "description": "This subject builds on the interplay between research and practice. It extends students' understanding of the processes and uses of participatory action research, also known in this context as teacher-based inquiry. It reviews theories on engaging practices in diverse professional contexts, with a focus on working with students from low socio-economic backgrounds, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island learners and students who have English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D). It also reviews pedagogic approaches linked to 21st century education. It challenges students to inquire into and reflect upon their professional practice and develop engaging classroom pedagogies and assessment practices in the area of their primary teaching specialisation (English, Mathematics or Science and Technology). The subject expands students' research skills through the critical review and application of various approaches to document, measure and evaluate student engagement. In line with NESA primary teaching specialisation requirements, students must apply these research skills and understandings to their school, classroom context and selected curriculum area specialisation. This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Master of Teaching program.",

    "description": "This subject analyses various aspects of the laws that regulate the media. The content of the subject includes defamation, contempt, privacy and surveillance and a selection of other laws impacting upon the media industry. It explores two key themes. The first is whether, as a question of policy, current legal restrictions to media freedom appropriately balance the protection of free speech with various other interests, including protection of reputation, personal privacy and the effective administration of justice. The second theme asks whether media laws that were developed to regulate traditional mass-media organisations apply to individuals who publish their own content online, particularly via social media, and, if so, whether this application is appropriately balanced. Analysis of the application of existing media law principles to a range of new technologies will be featured throughout the subject. Students will engage in professional learning activities to demonstrate their application of this body of law in practice.",

This will usually be done on a one- day (7 hours) per week basis.\nAn intern's duties will generally consist of a combination of substantive tasks relating to law, policy and practice. Depending on the host organisation, these may include a combination of research, preparing background materials, briefing papers or research reports, liaising with other organisations, assisting in the provision of legal assistance and advice, observing interviews with clients, conferences with Counsel or in court proceedings, undertaking project and advocacy work, preparing/ giving presentations and assisting with administrative and editing work. \nThe School will seek expressions of interest for the number of placements available with the School's partner host organisations each semester. \nStudents are also able to arrange their own internships at organisations that are not currently host organisations, subject to the approval of the Director / Principal Solicitor and the agreement of the host organisation to complete the attendance and assessment requirements of the subject.\n",

Concepts of motivation and emotion are central to understanding human psychology. The subject positions the topic in relation to other areas of psychological theory (such as learning theory, social psychology, personality, and cognition), investigates its role in psychological practice, and addresses its impact upon practical and philosophical debates within the discipline. Students are encouraged to explore and reflect upon the role of motivational systems in their own lives.",

After reviewing the biological basis of sensing and perceiving, we will explore the way this relatively raw information is processed and organised into the complex perceptions of the visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory and somatosensory systems, which constitute the fundamental basis of our experience of the world. The subject will also examine the history of perceptual theories and the use of psychophysical methods and experimental approaches to the study of perceptual processes",

The studio will engage with a real-world design project supported by First Nations consultation and expert mentoring giving students opportunities to implement aspects of Indigenous knowledge in their design process, project development, feasibility and design outcome. Students will gain skills in project development that includes intensive site analyses, the evaluation of multiple design options, designing the program through consultation and then implementing approaches with stakeholder feedback to satisfy the site and spatial requirements of the community. Students will learn about existing forms of knowledge and cultural histories in regard to site, as well as the ethical and cultural tools to engage with meaningful and appropriate consultation and co-design for major public projects. Through the design process, students will apply creative imagination, an understanding of design precedents, emergent knowledge, and skills in critical evaluation to create a detailed proposal for the given site and its community.\n\n",

The subject provides students with in-depth knowledge of cardiac anatomy, the vascular system, and the relevant protocols to create MRI sequences for the anatomical regions of MRC and MRA in different clinical examinations. It is expected that students will develop the ability to recognise normal anatomy, identify common pathologies and be able to provide diagnostic solutions and/or develop new MRI algorithms for clinical problems. They will have the ability to either produce, request or recommend the proper sequence and the best method of operating the MRI equipment for the anatomical region in question. The subject is offered to students who completed the Graduate Diploma in Advanced Imaging (MRI) 4768, with a varied pathway for the clinical component relevant to their undergraduate discipline. Students will have 2 weeks of clinical training in an MRI clinical site.",

This includes formulation of research questions or problems, the choice and articulation of appropriate methodologies; data gathering and analysis; and the preparation of a research report.  Students will learn to systematically question the dominant assumptions of their field and generate alternatives to a tendency for practitioner research to reproduce 'the same'.",

This subject equips students with skills in assessment, formulation and tailored psychological interventions for those who experience psychological distress within family systems and broader socio-cultural contexts; including abuse and violence; working within medico-legal systems, and broader socio-cultural contexts. The subject will explore theories, psychological techniques and prepare students to working within these settings that include inter-disciplinary collaboration and communication with multidisciplinary health services and legal practitioners.\n\nPlease note: some of the activities in this subject may include experiential learning, for example where students may be asked to take on the client role using their own lived experience, to provide opportunity for training in therapeutic modalities that are more “real-world”. Students may opt-out of these activities without consequence through speaking to the subject coordinator and alternative arrangements for student learning opportunities will be organised.",

This subject will cover psychological assessment, formulation that integrates medicine and psychology, clinical health psychology treatments and assessment of their outcomes.  Given that comorbidity has an impact on health outcomes, psychological practice when working with co-morbid substance use disorders will also be addressed. Practice within this branch of clinical psychology requires working within inter-disciplinary treatment contexts that include medical interventions and the tailoring of psychological interventions to help manage a medical condition and enhance quality of life.

We aim to supplement this information with online study guides, detailed module objectives and critical thinking exercises using online journal articles. The objective of this subject is to familiarize students with many of the most important toxic substances, their toxic effects, and ways to treat poisoned patients. Several example toxicants are presented and discussed in detail.. There are literally tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce, and nature offers even greater numbers of chemicals to which individuals are exposed. According to the basic tenets of toxicology, any of these substances in sufficient doses is toxic, although some clearly are of greater health concern than others. The objective of this subject is to provide the student with information on the toxic properties of selected chemicals to illustrate principles regarding mechanisms of toxicity, the array of signs and symptoms associated with intoxication, approaches to clinical assessment of poisoning, and methods of treatment. Examples have been selected from several chemical classes and include agents that may be encountered occupationally, environmentally, in medicine, or in the context of substance abuse.

Students enrolled in the subject with an offshore component must be available to travel for two weeks to the host country.  When no host country is available, this subject may be delivered wholly onshore (in Australia) only.  Students will be advised whether there is an offshore component of study and the availability of a host country in advance of opportunities to enrol.  When delivered offshore in a host country the teaching materials and tutorial activities will incorporate host country-specific issues and activities relevant to the topics covered in the subject.   Offshore delivery integrated with host country specific delivery provides the students with an immersive international and comparative experience, which will enhance their ability critically to engage with international law relevant to corporate governance.\n",

    "coordinator": "William Higgs",
    "description": "This subject examines the regulation of provision of financial advice within the Australian financial services sector - including the regulatory and legal obligations relating to financial advice that arise under Chapter 7 (\"Financial Services and Markets\") of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the reporting and notification requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules (AML/CTF Rules).  The main object of Chapter 7 is to promote: confident and informed decision making by consumers of financial products and services while facilitating efficiency, flexibility and innovation in the provision of those products and services; fairness, honesty and professionalism by those who provide financial services; fair, orderly and transparent markets for financial products; and the reduction of systemic risk and the provision of fair and effective services by clearing and settlement facilities.  Businesses that are required to comply with the AML/CTF Act are also required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) when handling personal information collected for the purposes of compliance with their AML/CTF Act obligations.  The subject examines the role of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) which is the Australian Government agency responsible for ensuring compliance with the AML/CTF Act.  The subject critically evaluates the reasons for regulation in the context of contemporary and evolving events which affect the financial services sector including the overarching Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). The subject also examines the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 (Cth) (TASA) requirements for tax (financial) advisors and the role of the Tax Practitioners Board (TPB) in enforcing the requirements under TASA.  The subject examines the professional and ethical obligations in providing financial advice and the consequences of failing to comply with these obligations with a particular focus upon the critical importance of professional ethical conduct, the consequences understanding the need to put the clients interest first, the importance of identifying and resolving conflict of interest, and the need to identify and avoid instances of professional misconduct and unsatisfactory conduct.  This subject is available as a standalone bridging subject which is accredited by the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority (FASEA) having met the FASEA curriculum and standards requirements.",

The exercise of power examined includes decision making, the exercise of discretion, delegated legislation and the decision making procedure of the major administrative tribunals.

This subject can be delivered either in a combination of onshore in Australia and offshore in a host country, or solely onshore in Australia. Students enrolled in the subject with an offshore component must be available to travel for two weeks to the host country.  When no host country is available, this subject may be delivered wholly onshore (in Australia) only.  Students will be advised whether there is an offshore component of study and the availability of a host country in advance of opportunities to enrol.  When delivered offshore in a host country the teaching materials will incorporate host country-specific issues and activities relevant to the topics covered in the subject. Offshore delivery integrated with host country specific delivery provides the students with an immersive international and comparative experience to help them develop their research project.",

Students will develop a value-laden negotiation toolbox and will grow in confidence in negotiations within a broad array of environments essential to the legal profession.  Students will examine written scholarship, engage in negotiation simulations involving role- scenarios, case hypotheticals, experimental games, and will become intricately involved in other negotiation-related scenarios.  Classes will include presentation of conceptual and strategic theories, simulations and role-playing scenarios applying these theories, and de-briefing of the theoretical and practical components of legal negotiation.",

    "description": "This subject follows from 102360 Core Therapeutic Modalities. Students in this subject will develop foundational skills in assessment, case formulation and treatment planning through understanding and developing skills in further evidence-based psychological therapies that may be modified based on an evolving case formulation and evaluation and tailored to the client as appropriate to their wider social and cultural context.  Further, students will be guided in critical examination of similarities and differences across those therapeutic approaches and their application across conditions, populations, settings and cultural contexts.  Please note: some of the activities in this subject may include experiential learning, for example where students may be asked to take on the client role using their own lived experience, to provide opportunity for training in therapeutic modalities that are more \"real life\". Students may opt-out of these activities without consequence through speaking to the subject coordinator and alternative arrangements for student learning opportunities will be organised.",

Through an analysis of the literature encompassing both evidence-based practice and practice-based evidence students will evaluate the implications of the model for individuals, families, teachers, other professionals, schools, services, their own practice and for systems practice.",

Strategies are critiqued based on their capacity to enhance learning outcomes for individuals with additional needs and to advance inclusion. These analyses are then used to develop strategies and methods which can facilitate the learning and inclusion of individuals with a range of abilities, skills and needs.

A focus on multiple relational influences enhances students' ability to work therapeutically with individuals, couples and families. Clients bring themselves and their current and past relationships into the therapy room with them, as does their counsellor. Students will have the opportunity to investigate their personal values and beliefs about relationships and how these influence their work with clients. Family life-cycle and developmental models are discussed, critiqued and applied to promote understanding of common and diverse client issues and presenting concerns. Ultimately students will explore the concept of interdependence and how relationship is central to human wellbeing.",

    "description": "This subject presents and explores ways of working therapeutically with trauma. The interpersonal neurobiologists' focus of Mind/Body connection features in detail in this subject. Work with emotions, embodiment and the counsellor/client relationship as instruments of therapeutic change will be considered. Students will learn what it means to be a trauma-sensitive therapist and develop techniques and methods for working across the spectrum of trauma responses including dissociation. A range of psychotherapeutic models will feature such as somatic therapies, sensorimotor psychotherapy, emotionally focused therapy, and notions of 'felt sense'. Complementary modes of healing, such as mindfulness, breathwork and the practices of yoga and meditation will be considered for what they can offer to a trauma-informed approach to therapy. Students will develop skills in working with emotions and nonverbal communication, as well as recognizing how the 'spoken' incorporates the physical.",

Students will also be introduced to common ways that clients present with psychological difficulties, and will explore various clinical responses to such client issues. These issues will be explored considering intrapsychic, relational and life stressor factors.

    "description": "This subject examines the different means in which the law protects workplace safety in Australia. The primary focus will be on the work health and safety regulatory framework and its underlying policy. The arbitrary nature of standard setting in the early systems of safety regulation is compared with later legislative models. The workings of these legislative strategies are illustrated by a series of selected issues relating to contemporary health risks in workplaces. Students will also examine issues surrounding enforcement and compliance and corporate governance in the safety context. Other topics include workers compensation and employment law.",

The theory and practice of mediation will be critically considered, as will the social and legal contexts within which mediation is practised. The subject is presented with a multi-disciplinary, analytical and practical approach, including the perspectives of First Nations peoples. It will focus on mediation in different legal contexts such as commercial litigation, employment law and family law. Issues of culture, power, mediator neutrality and ethical dilemmas for the mediator will be considered. This subject is intended to be an introduction to the practice of mediation.",

    "description": "This subject provides an internship opportunity for later year law students in host organisations (including NGOs and public interest organisations, community legal centres, government departments, corporations, barristers' chambers or private law firms).  Internships provide students with invaluable access to opportunities to understand the law in context, to apply their formal learning about legal principles, to develop essential professional skills and to gain exposure to different career pathways.  Students who successfully complete orientation requirements will spend twelve days throughout the semester at a host organisation. This will usually be done on a one- day (7 hours) per week basis.  An intern's duties will generally consist of a combination of substantive tasks relating to law, policy and practice. Depending on the host organisation, these may include a combination of research, preparing background materials, briefing papers or research reports, liaising with other organisations, assisting in the provision of legal assistance and advice, observing interviews with clients, conferences with Counsel or in court proceedings, undertaking project and advocacy work, preparing/ giving presentations and assisting with administrative and editing work.  The School will seek expressions of interest for the number of placements available with the School's partner host organisations each semester.   Students are also able to arrange their own internships at organisations that are not currently host organisations, subject to the approval of the Clinical Director and the agreement of the host organisation to complete the attendance and assessment requirements of the subject.",

The central content of the subject consists of defamation, contempt, privacy and surveillance and a selection of other laws impacting upon this industry. Throughout the subject we will also explore two key themes. The first is whether, as a question of policy, current legal restrictions to media freedom appropriately balance the protection of free speech with various other interests, including protection of reputation, personal privacy and the effective administration of justice. The second theme asks whether media laws that were developed to regulate traditional mass-media organisations apply to individuals who publish their own content online, particularly via social media, and, if so, whether this application is appropriately balanced. Analysis of the application of existing media law principles to a range of new technologies will be featured throughout the subject.",

The second part of the subject will discuss human rights from the perspective of nation states, examining the legal framework (in the context of Islamic and secular law) of key nation states, as well as that of some international organisations (including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League). Students will examine whether there is an ideal governance framework to protect human rights and discuss core international human rights treaties including Islamic Human Rights instruments (i.e. the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam and the Arab Charter on Human Rights). Students will discuss specific human rights issues including Islam and gender, Islam and freedom of expression, Islam and freedom of religion and Islamic criminal law. When examining these topics, students will be encouraged to engage with various interpretations of Islamic law, as well as critically examine the human rights framework.",

    "description": "This subject examines the theory and practice of international human rights law through the framework of specific, current human rights issues. The Subject examines the moral and political justification for human rights; the foundations and historical development of key human rights instruments and institutions; the domestic, regional and global organisations that contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights; and challenges to realising human rights in different economic, cultural and religious contexts. Through a focus on contemporary issues and debates (which might include for example, the scope of the right to privacy; the effectiveness of measures to prevent genocide; the vulnerability of women and children in conflict situations) the Subject encourages a critical examination of the interconnectedness of rights and the way international human rights law is deployed to expand (or constrain) possibilities for social change and justice. The subject integrates the experience of the teachers as active human rights practitioners and academics in a range of institutions such as with National Human Rights Institutions, Human Rights NGOs,  and Subjected Nations bodies to interrogate the range of ways in which human rights can be used to advance the equality and dignity of humanity.",

    "description": "The role of corporations in society has become increasingly significant in shaping economic, social, and environmental outcomes. In such a context, understanding the concept of corporate governance is imperative in any attempt at controlling corporations and their behaviour. Through an interdisciplinary approach, this subject explores the place and role of the modern for-profit business corporation in advanced and emerging economies. It examines the public and private roles of corporations, their external and internal orientation, and issues relating to their accountability, responsibility, and transparency. The students will engage in critical analysis of the contemporary issues in the governance of corporations within the broad theoretical framework of corporate governance.  \n\nThis subject can be taught either in a combination of onshore in Australia and offshore in a host country, or solely onshore in Australia. Students enrolled in the subject with an offshore component must be available to travel for two weeks to the host country.  When no host country is available, this subject may be delivered wholly onshore (in Australia) only.  Students will be advised whether there is an offshore component of study and the availability of a host country in advance of opportunities to enrol.  When delivered offshore in a host country the teaching materials and tutorial activities will incorporate host country-specific issues and activities relevant to the topics covered in the subject.   Offshore delivery integrated with host country specific delivery provides the students with an immersive international and comparative experience, which will enhance their ability critically to engage with Australian and international law relevant to corporate governance.\n",

Cyber war and cyber terrorism offer new risks for the international community. Bullying, identity theft and bank fraud, on a more local level, are given a new life in the cyber world.  Cyber technologies also provide enhanced opportunities for detecting and apprehending criminals, resolving disputes and modernising justice processes. New social spaces are opened up (social media networks, the 'dark web'), and new identities made possible (online grooming profile, avatars). How does the law keep up with the emergence of new crimes and technology-enhanced versions of old ones, and how do the cultural worlds of hackers, crackers and trackers work?  The subject examines how justice processes and spaces, as well as criminal networks and strategies, are being reimagined to take advantage of the new technologies.",
