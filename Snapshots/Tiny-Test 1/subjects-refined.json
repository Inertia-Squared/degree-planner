Throughout the subject, students are challenged to consider how they think as opposed to how they think they think (biases and heuristics). A clear understanding of the necessity of systems thinking approaches in leadership paradigms equips students to be the leaders of tomorrow.",

    "description": "Media memory is now a critical field of study in journalism, advertising, visual communication and media. The media builds local, national and transnational identities through the representation of the past. Media industries such as advertising rely upon collective memories to design campaigns in order to reach particular audiences. Journalists increasingly 'assemble' stories from digital archives, recombining similar or related events from the past to build stories and features of the present. Individuals increasingly contribute to news events through their own 'witnessing' of events, capturing and sharing material using mobile and social media. This subject addresses these processes by providing a brief history and overview of approaches to thinking about media and memory, in the context of the significance of media convergence and digital memory within contemporary media ecologies. The subject provides students with a series of case studies that approach the memory of particular events, drawing on examples from advertising, public relations, visual communication, animation, film, broadcasting and journalism. Students develop a media research project that engages with the material presented in the subject.",

With access to increasing amounts and types of data, professional communicators need to be able to extract meaning to connect with a variety of different audiences in creative, dynamic, and emotional ways. This subject introduces students to story archetypes, structure and flow. It encourages metaphorical and anagogical storytelling using appropriation making reference to genre and research. This practical subject explores a range of traditional hands-on techniques and digital software commonly used across the communications sector.  Students are encouraged to explore and develop their own mark and image making skills aimed at specific target audiences and communication contexts.",

One way to do this is to set up a mathematical model which we hope can provide insights, predictions and a greater understanding of a complex system. Selected real-world problems are approximated by mathematical models that are amenable to being written in terms of linear and non-linear equations or differential equations.  Once equations are solved emphasis is placed on interpreting solutions, modifying models as required and using  models for prediction.",

In addition, students study the dynamics of a non-rotating body, and a body rotating about a fixed axis.  Further, they study the friction between bodies.  Students conduct experiments to see how the lecture content applies to the real world, and make extensive use of vector algebra.",

    "description": "The subject equips students with formal tools to analyse macroeconomic problems. Students learn to use macroeconomic terms and measures competently in discussion, and interpret data from the income, product, external and government accounts, and labour force surveys. Through hands-on experience constructing and applying price indices, deflators and productivity measures, they acquire practical skills and a sound conceptual understanding of economic variables and the accounting framework. Students come to appreciate the power of macroeconomic models, learning how to capture myriad mechanisms and feedbacks in a single framework, for example to define and quantify multipliers and crowding-out effects. Finally, students gain an understanding of fundamental external constraints, such as international parity and balance of payments equilibrium conditions.",

Media consumers are producing and circulating content about crime and criminality through new media technologies, and some are using social media and the internet to engage in new forms of criminality. In this subject, we explore the complex role of mass media and 'new' media in debates over crime and crime control, and the facilitation of criminality by media technologies. This means studying contemporary media theory and its relevance for criminology, and the effects of social media and computing technology on representations and practices of criminality. The subject maintains a strong focus on the ways in which media and culture informs crime policy and criminal justice processes.",

Cyber war and cyber terrorism offer new risks for the international community. Bullying, identity theft and bank fraud, on a more local level, are given a new life in the cyber world.  Cyber technologies also provide enhanced opportunities for detecting and apprehending criminals, resolving disputes and modernising justice processes. New social spaces are opened up (social media networks, the 'dark web'), and new identities made possible (online grooming profile, avatars). How does the law keep up with the emergence of new crimes and technology-enhanced versions of old ones, and how do the cultural worlds of hackers, crackers and trackers work?  The subject examines how justice processes and spaces, as well as criminal networks and strategies, are being reimagined to take advantage of the new technologies.",

    "description": "Product development is about expanding on a creative, innovative idea or concept through specific stages into a product or service. Students apply practical learning techniques in each of the stages for the product or service development. In addition, students use a human-centred design approach to explore a problem and include a ‘human’ or user perspective in addressing the problem. The approach includes creating a digital or physical prototype to test the product or service concept with potential customers. Students create and apply methods to collect feedback from potential customers which is used to refine their prototype. In these activities students are applying critical and creative thinking, decision making and communication skills which are essential employability skills.\n\n\n",

The design and role of various health classification systems including the World Health Organizations Family of International Classifications (WHO FIC), specifically ICD 11 and casemix classification systems (e.g. AR DRGs, AN SNAP) will also be discussed. The practical component of this subject will focus on the student further developing their classification skills in the more complex areas of clinical coding including endocrine disorders, specifically diabetes mellitus, circulatory diseases and interventions, genitourinary disorders, specifically chronic kidney disease, obstetrics, paediatrics and congenital anomalies and trauma and procedural complications. The ACS will be applied in detail when classifying from complex discharge summaries and full clinical episodes of care. The student will also be exposed to electronic clinical coding tools that can be used in the classification process.",

Humans are an essential part of security and privacy, and they also inherently pose significant challenges. Students will be introduced to some of the fundamental security and privacy standards and regulations. They will learn about cognitive and perceptual approaches to usable security as well as how to create systems that are usable and trusted alongside fulfilling the requirements of remaining secure and private. Research topics such as how to design user studies to critically evaluate security, privacy, trust and usability interfaces will be addressed to provide students with an informed view on emerging best practices.",

Students will do an internal cyber security placement with the new live security operations centre known as the Western centre for Cybersecurity Aid and Community Engagement (Western CACE).  Western CACE will provide training for students as well as members of the small business communities with cyber preparedness training.  Students will be guided through handling real cyber attacks and assisting small business respond to these attacks.  There are a paucity of government services that address and aid small business with live cyber attacks.  Western CACE fills this necessary gap where students will exit knowing how to deal with ransomware, payment diversion fraud, data breach, emerging threats, and the security control implementations post-incident.   The placement with Western CACE acts as a stepping stone to their next placement which is their external industry placement (INFO 3017 Cyber Security and Behaviour Industry Placement). A two day induction/workshops will be conducted in the week prior to commencing with Western CACE with ongoing professional development onsite within the Centre as directed by the Centre Manager, Director and industry leaders.     WSU Online students will not do a face to face placement at Western CACE unless they are able to attend face to face sessions in Sydney for both INFO 2008 Cyber Incident Response and Risk Management and this unit. WSU Online students will have the following options: an approved placement at the student's place of work, or via the student's networks and contacts OR an industry project report based on industry-generated case studies and problems.",

This subject will introduce the fundamental tenets of risk management, and explore cybersecurity risk management frameworks.  Cyber incident response is an organised approach to addressing and managing a major security breach, threat or attack.  The goal is to handle the incident in a way that limits damage, reduces recovery time and losses, and take pro-active measures in the follow up and recovery phase to prevent future attacks.  Students will explore common cyber attacks requiring incident response such as payment diversion fraud (business email compromise), ransomware, data breach, and advanced persistent threats.  They will learn about each of these threats and how to manage such threats through the development of incident response plans including people, process, technology and information.  This subject is taught with industry partners through case studies and simulations.  Due to the sensitive nature of the subject and the requirement of hands on training, it cannot be taught online and is not on offer to WSU Online students.  Online students will take an additional elective.",

    "description": "This subject examines identity in a digitalising society. It asks questions such as: who are we becoming with digital technologies? How are digital experiences shaped by long standing social inequalities? Students learn about identities as the flows of data across formalised systems of governance and commerce, and as the ways we make ourselves in interactions with others in social media spaces. Pressing issues are explored such as online harm, privacy, surveillance, and human rights. Students reflect upon personal and professional digital identities, and reimagine digital technologies and social media for new possibilities of identity, equity and justice.",

Students learn how to develop, test and integrate client (front-end) and server (back-end) parts of the software system. The subject will explore various options for the client-server data communication, using either REST APIs, sockets for live subscriptions or graph-based solutions. The subject focuses also on various testing approaches (i.e. unit, integration and end to end), continuous delivery, containerisation with Docker, integration and deployment procedures. Students use versioning control and engage with the Github platform for project management and quality control; developing authentic, real-world projects. \n\nBased on the performance in the subject, a selected number of students will have the opportunity to undergo a week-long placement with a target business partner. Students doing the placement will work on industry projects assessed by professional staff at their placement venue.\n\n",

Students learn a contextual history of 20th century design practice by studying the doctrines around which the modernist movement cohered, and the conditions under which these doctrines are challenged by later movements. The subject explores various roles of the visual designer through history-avant-garde, futurist, revolutionary, utopian design; client-service design; social activism, producer and digital enabler. These roles are expressed across a range of design outcomes such as photography, typography, illustration, print media, graphics, digital design, film and animation. Part of this exploration will examine the impacts of design histories on our past, present and future conditions, as well as changing the future for design. Students will complete visual and writing tasks that aim to build their understanding of design histories and futures, and scholarship in academic research and writing.",
