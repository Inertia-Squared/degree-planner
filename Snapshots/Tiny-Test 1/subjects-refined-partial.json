In this subject students learn the skills required for accurate requirements gathering, timely and effective system development, and successful implementation that would result in effective system performance. For this to be achieved successfully this subject also addresses the importance of project management skills. The subject also highlights the issues of transition processes after the development phase, the activities required in systems support and maintenance in the system's operational stage.",

The abstract concepts introduced in the subject, ring theory, field theory and algebraic equations, have many applications in science and technology. The theory of algebraic equations is the study of solutions of polynomial equations. Although the problem originates in explicit manipulations of polynomials, the modern (and far more powerful) treatment is in terms of field extensions. The subject is an introduction to ring theory and field theory; it includes applications to cryptography (RSA) and geometry (proving that it is impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle using only a straightedge and compass).",

Symmetry plays a role in many different contexts:  in crystals, in visual arts, in music and in architecture, to name a few.  Analysing and exploiting the symmetries of a particular problem often is the first step towards finding a practical solution to the problem.  Group theory is the study of symmetry.

One way to do this is to set up a mathematical model which we hope can provide insights, predictions and a greater understanding of a complex system. Selected real-world problems are approximated by mathematical models that are amenable to being written in terms of linear and non-linear equations or differential equations.  Once equations are solved emphasis is placed on interpreting solutions, modifying models as required and using  models for prediction.",

Data Science is the investigation of the tools required that allow us to perform this modelling and prediction. The increase in accessible data over the past few decades has promoted the use of Data Science, making it a desired skill in many professions. In this subject we further investigate the methods of regression, clustering and classification that form the basis of a data scientist's toolbox.",

Necessary mathematical preliminaries are included. Then, this subject discusses major quantum algorithms and communication protocols. Quantum programming will be practised throughout this subject with quantum simulators and real quantum computers in clouds. Students completing this subject will develop skills for designing quantum algorithms/protocols and conducting quantum programming and can pursue careers such as quantum software engineers, quantum security engineers or quantum researchers.\n\n",

Humans are an essential part of security and privacy, and they also inherently pose significant challenges. Students will be introduced to some of the fundamental security and privacy standards and regulations. They will learn about cognitive and perceptual approaches to usable security as well as how to create systems that are usable and trusted alongside fulfilling the requirements of remaining secure and private. Research topics such as how to design user studies to critically evaluate security, privacy, trust and usability interfaces will be addressed to provide students with an informed view on emerging best practices.",

It covers practical skills in different stages of ethical hacking, including reconnaissance on public information, port and vulnerability scanning, exploitation of vulnerabilities, post exploitation, and writing a comprehensive report to document detected vulnerabilities and proposed solutions. Students will not only practise with major tools in ethical hacking, but also learn the principles of how these tools work and hence how to defend against them. Students completing this subject can pursue careers such as ethical hackers, security architects or security analysts.\n\n",

WSU-brokered industry placement on a competitive basis; 2. an approved placement at the student's place of work, or via the student's networks and contacts; 3. an industry project report based on industry-generated case studies and problems.  Students may continue the option chosen for Cyber Security and Behaviour Placement 1, or choose another available option.   Workshops will be conducted throughout the semester to aid in your learning and to support your professional development during this placement or project. Contact the subject coordinator well in advance to elect your own industry placement (such as your current employer).   Only options 2 and 3 are available to WSU Online students.",

Whilst this has interest on a personal level, the killer-apps will be in analysing social Web data for business, such as tracking the buzz around a new product, and understanding the relationships between customers and products. This subject will introduce its students to the Social Web data that is available, and blend data science and machine learning concepts to allow extraction and analysis of such data.",

Machine Learning is relevant for solving a range of problems in many industries dealing with significant amounts of information and the structure of that information. In this unit, students put Machine Learning theory into action through widely used algorithms and practical applications for designing, training, and evaluating common learning models and systems. Students use Python programming and, as a result, learn about its important machine learning libraries and packages, such as Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow for solving practical problems and tasks.",

The subject focuses also on various testing approaches (i.e. unit, integration and end to end), continuous delivery, containerisation with Docker, integration and deployment procedures. Students use versioning control and engage with the Github platform for project management and quality control; developing authentic, real-world projects. \n\nBased on the performance in the subject, a selected number of students will have the opportunity to undergo a week-long placement with a target business partner.

Students will interrogate the fundamental principles of branding and explore diverse and creative approaches to branding and visual identity design from concept to outcome. Students' understanding of a design brief, client, competitors and audience will deepen and they will be introduced to some design specific research skills, such as mood board and persona development, which will help them begin to build a toolkit of methods to use throughout their degree. Students will explore the power of storytelling in the creation of compelling brand narratives and explore ways a brand can communicate with an intended audience. Key software will be introduced and supported by online resources, and students will continue to develop their visual design and communication skills in the fundamental areas of typography, image-making and composition.",
